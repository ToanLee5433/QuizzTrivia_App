## ✅ Updated Files

### Updated Exports

- `src/App.tsx`: Removed LoginPageNew import and route

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. NPM Test System
- ❌ **Jest Configuration Issues**: Fixed config file references in package.json
- 🔧 **Solution**: Created proper jest.config.cjs with TypeScript support
- ⚠️ **Status**: Still needs more TypeScript preset configuration for full functionality

### 2. Admin Quiz Management Logic
- ❌ **Approve/Unapprove Button Logic**: Fixed incorrect logic where "Hủy duyệt" was calling approve function
- 🔧 **Solution**: 
  - Added `handleUnapprove` function to change approved quizzes back to pending
  - Updated UI to show different buttons based on quiz status:
    - **Pending**: Show "Duyệt" (green) button
    - **Approved**: Show "Hủy duyệt" (orange) button  
    - **Rejected**: Show "Duyệt lại" (green) button
  - Conditional rendering for reject button (hidden for already rejected quizzes)

### 3. Edit Quiz Routing
- ❌ **404 Error on Edit**: Edit button was navigating to `/quiz/:id` instead of edit page
- 🔧 **Solution**: 
  - Added new route `/quiz/:id/edit` for admin editing
  - Updated `handleEdit` to navigate to correct edit route
  - Protected edit route with admin role requirement

### 4. Notification Banner UI
- ❌ **UI Coverage Issue**: Notification banner was covering main interface
- 🔧 **Solution**:
  - Made notification banner fixed positioned at top with z-index
  - Added better styling with shadow and improved close button
  - Added app container wrapper for better layout management

### 5. Creator Management
- ✅ **Already Working**: Creator management has proper Firebase integration
- ✅ **Route Available**: `/admin/creators` route exists and accessible
- ✅ **Features Working**: User listing, role management, statistics

### 6. Category Management  
- ✅ **Firebase Integration**: Complete CRUD operations for categories
- ✅ **Mock Data Fallback**: Has backup data when Firebase fails
- ✅ **Quiz Count Tracking**: Shows number of quizzes per category

## ✅ AdminQuizManagement Rebuild

### Complete Firebase Integration
- Full CRUD operations with Firestore
- Real-time quiz loading with proper error handling
- Status management (pending, approved, rejected)

### UI Components

  2. ✅ **Duyệt** (Approve) - Green button - For pending/rejected quizzes
  3. 🔶 **Hủy duyệt** (Unapprove) - Orange button - For approved quizzes
  4. ✏️ **Sửa** (Edit) - Blue button - Always available (routes to edit page)
  5. ❌ **Từ chối** (Reject) - Red button - For non-rejected quizzes
  6. 🗑️ **Xóa** (Delete) - Red button - Always available

### Features
