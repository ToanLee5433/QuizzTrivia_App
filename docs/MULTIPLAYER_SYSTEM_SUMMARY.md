## ðŸš€ Integration Guide

### Basic Integration

```tsx
import { MultiplayerManager } from '@/features/multiplayer';

function QuizApp() {
  const [selectedQuiz, setSelectedQuiz] = useState<Quiz | null>(null);
  
  return (
    <MultiplayerManager
      selectedQuiz={selectedQuiz}
      currentUserId="user123"
      currentUserName="Player Name"
      onBackToQuizSelection={() => setSelectedQuiz(null)}
      onQuizComplete={(results) => console.log('Quiz finished:', results)}
    />
  );
}
```

### Advanced Integration

```tsx
import { 
  GameModeSelector, 
  CreateRoomModal, 
  JoinRoomModal, 
  RoomLobby,
  MultiplayerQuiz,
  getMultiplayerService 
} from '@/features/multiplayer';

// For custom implementations, use individual components
function CustomMultiplayerFlow() {
  const [gameState, setGameState] = useState('mode-selection');
  const multiplayerService = getMultiplayerService();
  
  // Connect to service
  useEffect(() => {
    multiplayerService.connect(userId, userName);
    return () => multiplayerService.disconnect();
  }, []);
  
  // Use components individually for custom flows
  return (
    <>
      {gameState === 'mode-selection' && (
        <GameModeSelector
          isOpen={true}
          onClose={handleClose}
          onSelectSinglePlayer={handleSinglePlayer}
          onSelectMultiplayer={handleMultiplayer}
        />
      )}
      {/* Additional states... */}
    </>
  );
}
```

## ðŸ”Œ WebSocket Events

The system supports these real-time events:

<GameModeSelector
  className="custom-theme"
  // Override default styles
/>
```

### Service Configuration
```tsx
// Configure WebSocket URL
const service = new EnhancedMultiplayerService();
await service.connect(userId, userName);

// Or use mock service for development
const mockService = new MockMultiplayerService();
```

## ðŸ“± Mobile Optimization

5. **Analytics**: Track game events and user behavior

## ðŸ’¡ Usage Examples

### Simple Integration
For most use cases, just use the `MultiplayerManager` component - it handles everything automatically.

### Custom Integration  
For advanced use cases, import individual components and build your own flow.

### Development Mode
The system automatically uses mock services when `REACT_APP_WS_URL` is not configured, making development easy.
